"""Build the evidence bundle the AI review judges, and redact it first.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
The old rationale call showed the model seven fields, none of which was
evidence, and asked it why a finding mattered. It could only paraphrase the
title. The review (Step C) instead shows it the actual proof — the request, the
response excerpt, the file path, the validation result — and asks it to check
the four factors against that. Everything it says must be quoted from this
bundle, and the quote is verified in code.

THREE RULES

1. **Secrets are redacted BEFORE the bundle is built**, from the same value
   fields the group key hashes, so no raw value can reach a prompt. A redacted
   secret still carries what the model needs: its shape, its detector and where
   it was found.
2. **Every field is capped, and the bundle is capped again.** An unbounded
   `raw_response` is both a cost problem and an injection surface.
3. **The whole bundle is wrapped as untrusted.** It is scanner output and target
   response bodies: prompt injection is expected, not exceptional. The wrapper
   is not the defence (the output validation is); it is what makes the boundary
   legible to the model.

THE HASH IS WHAT A REVIEW IS VALID FOR. `bundle_hash` is sha256 over the
normalised, redacted bundle alone, stored as `triage_evidence_hash`. A review
(the built-in AI's, or an external agent's over MCP) records the hash it read
and counts only while the two are equal, so a rescan that changes the evidence
retires it and a rescan that changes only a `Date` header does not.

`build_bundle_legacy` is the pre-v3.2 builder, kept for exactly one job: telling
whether a review a v3.1 run stored still describes the evidence
(`evidence_hash` with `LEGACY_REVIEW_PROMPT_VERSION`).
