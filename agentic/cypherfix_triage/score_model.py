"""The risk model behind the Priority Board (score model v3).

WHY THIS REPLACED A POINTS FORMULA
The old model added points per signal. That is wrong in ways that showed up on
real graphs, not just on paper:

- it counted one fact two or three times (severity, CVSS score and CVSS vector
  all describe the same thing);
- it summed signals measuring the same thing (KEV + EPSS + a public PoC);
- it ADDED impact and likelihood, but risk is likelihood x impact, so something
  harmless and trivially exploitable could outrank something devastating;
- proof sat outside everything else, so a proven exploit on a host that has
  since been patched or has vanished stayed at the top;
- missing data was sometimes neutral and sometimes zero;
- bands came from arbitrary thresholds, so enough weak signals crossed into
  "Critical". On the live dev graph that put 119 GitHub "secrets" that are
  private IP addresses at the top of the board, each scoring ~540, while an
  ungraded advisory on a live dependency scored ~0.

THE MODEL
For every open finding we estimate four things, each between 0 and 1:

    C  P(the finding is real)              how it was detected
    L  P(exploited | real)                 the strongest exploit signal, not a sum
    I  impact                              the CVSS impact part, else severity, else class
    R  reachability                        how an attacker gets to it

    risk  r = min(1, C x L x I x R)
    tier    = T1 Act now | T2 Act soon | T3 Plan | T4 Track   (fixed rules)
    score   = 25 x tier_level + 25 x r      T1=3 T2=2 T3=1 T4=0   ->  0 to 100

Sorting by `score` is exactly "tier first, then risk", so a bigger score always
means more urgent, with no exceptions. The breakdown reads as a sentence:
`real 95% x exploit 70% x impact 0.75 x reach 1.0 -> Act soon, 62.5`.

STATE COMES FIRST. A fixed, gone or inactive finding leaves the ranking
entirely instead of being demoted to a small number that still sorts above a
real one.

This module is PURE: no I/O, no graph, no clock, no randomness. Every table is
data, so the Phase 6 calibration is a diff of numbers rather than of code, and
`SCORE_MODEL_VERSION` changes with them. The AI review (Step C) corrects the
FACTORS and re-runs these same rules; it never produces a score.
