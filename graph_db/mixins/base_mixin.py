        WHY THIS REPLACED CLEAR-THEN-INGEST
        Every scanner used to DELETE its findings up front and re-create them.
        That deleted the operator's work with them: the mute they applied, the
        verdict they recorded, the AI's cached review, the link from a fix item
        back to the finding. Re-muting the same noise after every scan was the
        visible symptom; the invisible one was a fix item pointing at a finding
        id that no longer existed.

        So a scan now MERGEs its findings (which refreshes `updated_at`), and
        afterwards this removes the ones it did not touch. `updated_at` is
        already stamped by every node write and is already tested as universal,
        so "not seen in this run" is just "older than the run started".

        TWO RULES THAT MAKE IT SAFE
        1. A finding a PERSON touched is never deleted. Findings an operator
           muted and human-judged findings are kept and stamped `stale_since`
           instead, so the board can show them as resolved and an operator can
           see that the scanner stopped reporting something they had suppressed.
           A mute a node-filter RULE applied (`muted_by` starting `rule:`) is not
           a person's decision about that finding, so it is pruned like any
           other stale finding; the operator's exemptions live in Postgres and
           need no node to survive.
        2. CALL THIS ONLY AFTER A SUCCESSFUL INGEST. A scan that failed halfway
           reported nothing, and pruning on that would delete the entire
           project's findings. The caller owns that decision; this method
           cannot tell.

        `keep_hosts` are hostnames a degraded run skipped as unreachable: every
        finding about one of them is left exactly as it is (neither deleted
        nor stamped stale), since the run never re-checked it. Per host rather
        than per source, so one permanently dead host cannot keep a whole
        source unpruned for ever. With it empty the query is unchanged.
