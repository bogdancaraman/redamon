"""
Cache Poisoning Scanner - Web Cache Deception probe (taxonomy class 10).

Deception needs an AUTHENTICATED page. An attacker crafts a static-looking URL
(``/account/x.css``) that the origin serves as the sensitive page -- it ignores the
appended segment -- but the shared cache stores as a static asset, then reads the
victim's data from the cache with NO session. So this probe only runs when the project
has an auth profile in scope: it fetches the page authenticated, proves it is
personalised, then proves a crafted static-suffix URL is (a) served the sensitive
content by the origin and (b) returned FROM CACHE to an unauthenticated request.

Without the auth half a "deception" verdict is only WCVS's opinion wearing a native
label; this is the native, auth-aware confirmation the taxonomy asks for.
