"""
Subdomain Discovery & DNS Resolution - Unified OSINT tool
Discovers subdomains using crt.sh (crt.name when crt.sh gives no answer),
HackerTarget, Subfinder, Amass, and Knockpy.
Resolves full DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, SOA, CNAME) for domain and all subdomains.
Outputs a single JSON report.

Parallelization:
- All 5 discovery tools run concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor (fan-out/fan-in)
- DNS resolution runs concurrently across subdomains (configurable worker count)
