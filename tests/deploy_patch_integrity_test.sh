# T3 — deploy source-mutation integrity + app-config passthrough.
#
# HISTORY: this suite used to verify that deploy.sh's deploy-time `git apply`
# patches were sha256-pinned and fatal-on-failure. That mechanism is GONE
# (d2d743fb): the last patch, which injected NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_WS_URL into
# webapp/Dockerfile, was folded into the base Dockerfile as a first-class build
# ARG. The suite kept asserting a pinned sha for a deleted file and had been red
# ever since.
#
# The invariant worth guarding is the STRONGER one that replaced it: deploy.sh
# must never mutate repo source on the host at all. A deploy-time edit dirties
# the checkout, which breaks `redamon.sh update`'s `git pull --ff-only` on the
# next run — the exact failure the patch removal was meant to end.
#
# Second half: operator app-config that deploy.sh must forward. redamon.sh reads
# these from the server-side .env, so a knob missing from ANY of the three
# plumbing points (defaults / deploy.env export list / seed) is silently inert
# on a deployed host while working perfectly in a local install.
#
# Run: bash tests/deploy_patch_integrity_test.sh
