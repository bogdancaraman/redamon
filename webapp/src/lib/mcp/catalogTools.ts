/**
 * The tool that explains the recon pipeline rather than reading a project.
 * (Its sibling, list_recon_presets, reads the user's presets now and lives in
 * presetTools.ts.)
 *
 * `update_recon_settings` was a 126-field API whose only reference manual was
 * `get_recon_settings`, which returns key names and current values: no meaning,
 * no type, no bounds, no enum domains, no grouping. An agent learned a bound by
 * being refused, one field at a time, and because one bad key refuses the WHOLE
 * call, a batch of guesses applied nothing at all.
 *
 * It follows the `graph_schema` shape: no projectId, no database, no tenant
 * data. It is derived from constants in this build, so it still answers when
 * Neo4j and Postgres are down.
 *
 * It is served from `recon_settings/registry.yaml`, which carries the
 * unit, the phase, the traffic class, the engagement-cap flag, the bounds or
 * the validator, and a meaning for every one of the 712 Project columns. The
 * reference manual and the thing it describes are therefore the same file, so
 * an agent that trusts `describe_recon_settings` cannot be surprised by
 * `update_recon_settings`.

    'scanned, and no result field says why. Enable the phase AND at least one tool in it.',
  'A phase that is not in scanModules does not run whatever its tools are set to.',

    'rather than probing for them.',

    'refused with a pointer to the right tool.',

    'roeForbiddenTools, roeForbiddenCategories, the allow flags and roeMaxSeverityPhase - ARE ' +
    'listed and ARE settable here, in either direction. What keeps them honest is not a ' +
    'write-time direction rule but that every one of them is enforced at scan start whatever ' +
    'the setting says: a ceiling still rewrites all 17 rate fields, an excluded host is still ' +
    'dropped in three places. Read preflight_scope_check to see the resolved configuration.',
  'The engagement RECORD - the client name, the contacts, the dates, the document - is not ' +
    'here and is not writable by any tool on this surface. It is the contract, a person ' +
    'writes it, and it carries third-party personal data.',
  'A value is VALIDATED and then CAPPED, not blocked. A rate above the engagement ceiling is ' +
    'rewritten to the ceiling at scan start, and a container image outside the shipped ' +
    'allowlist is pinned back to the default. get_recon_settings echoes what you wrote; ' +
    'preflight_scope_check reports what will actually run.',
  'Where zeroMeans is "unlimited", 0 is the FASTEST value the field accepts and not the ' +
    'safest. Under an engagement ceiling a 0 there is rewritten to the ceiling.',
  'Settings apply to the NEXT scan. A scan already running read its settings when it started.',
  'AI hooks have THREE levels: aiInPipeline, then the per-hook AI flag, then the *UseJev engine. ' +
    'At scan start aiInPipeline forces every per-hook AI flag to its own value; it does not touch ' +

    'aiPipelineModel, true = TypeSafe Jev), and switching one ON is refused unless the project ' +
    'owner has a Jev token. preflight_scope_check reports each hook\'s effective engine.',
  'Jev-only hooks have TWO levels: aiInPipeline, then the hook\'s own *Jev* flag (ffufJevBasePaths, ' +
    'httpxJevPageType, resourceEnumJevToolHealth, hakrawlerJevSeedOrder, serializedScanJevRank). ' +
    'They have no LLM engine, aiInPipeline does not set or reset them, and switching one ON is ' +
    'refused unless the project owner has a Jev token. Page types, base paths and seed order take ' +
    'effect from Jev\'s answers (page-type labels land on the Endpoint, FFuf fuzzes Jev\'s ' +
    'directories, Hakrawler crawls Jev\'s host order, and each serialized-object candidate gets ' +
    'Jev\'s deser_jev_format and deser_jev_exploitability, the order the deserialization skill ' +
